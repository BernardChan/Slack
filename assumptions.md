# Assumptions for the slackr Project
- Emails with the plus `+` delimiter and the period `.` delimiter will be treated as different emails
- The string `"THISISNOTATOKEN"` is not a valid token
- ".", "+", "=" and other symbols can be in a name as long as they are in a string
- Names with numbers in them are valid
- Names with special characters ("\n", "\t", etc.) are valid names as long as they are in a string
- "Between 1 and 50 characters" in project spec is inclusive (includes names with 1 and 50 characters)
